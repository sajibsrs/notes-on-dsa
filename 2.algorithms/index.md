# Algorithms
Algorithm is the step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem. For instance, everybody knows how to make a lemonade. If we create a algorithm for making lemonade, that would be something like this:

1. Take a glass
2. Put some lemon juice
3. Add water
4. Add sugar
5. Mix them together
