## Complexities table

Functions are arranged in ascending order according to their efficiency.

| Position | Complexity | Name               | Example                                          |
| :------: | :--------: | :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
|    1     |    $1$     | Constant           | Adding and element to the front of a linked list |
|    2     |  $log n$   | Logarithmic        | Finding and element in a sorted array            |
|    3     |    $n$     | Linear             | Finding an element in an unsorted array          |
|    4     | $n log n$  | Linear Logarithmic | Sorting n items by divide-and-conquer Merge sort |
|    5     |   $n^2$    | Quadratic          | Shortest path between two nodes in a graph       |
|    6     |   $n^3$    | Cubic              | Matrix multiplication                            |
|    7     |   $2^n$    | Exponential        | The towers of hanoi problem                      |
