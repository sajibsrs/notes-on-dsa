# Set
A set is very similar to array, except set doesn't allow _duplicate values_. There are different types of sets, but we'll discuss about _array-based_ set.

For this example we'll be using the same example from the array. This array is a set as all of it's items are unique.

```python
animals = ["dog", "cat", "cow", "goat", "sheep"]
```

## Required steps for specific operation on a set

### Reading

[//]: # (add description)

> Required steps `worst` = n, when it's the last item

[//]: # (add description)

### Insertion
> Required steps `best` = n + 1, when it's the last item

[//]: # (add description)

> Required steps `worst` = 2n + 1, when it's the first item

[//]: # (add description)

### Deletetion
> Required steps `best` = 1, when it's the last item
