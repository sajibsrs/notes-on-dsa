# Data structures
Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data, that can be used efficiently later on.

Based on arrangement of the elements, data structures can be classified into two types:

### 1. Linear data structures:
Elements are accessed in a sequential order but sequentially storing them is not essential. Example:
- Linked lists, Stacks, Queues.

### 2. Non-linear data structures:
Elements are stored and accessed in a non-linear order. Example:
- Trees, Graphs
