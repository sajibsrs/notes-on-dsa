# Data types

In the heart of computer there's only binary numbers, which is 1's and 0's. Solving real life problems in binary would have been extremely difficult if not impossible. To overcome this problem programming languages provides us data types. Integer, float, boolean, character etc are some of the most common data types.

## Primitive/System-defined data types

Data types that are defined by system are called primitive data types. Int, float, double, char, string, bool etc are the common primitive or system defined data types.

## User-defined data types

For many situations only primitive data types are not enough. Most programming languages allow the users to define their own custom data types, which is called user-defined data types. Structures and classes are example of user-defined data types.

## Abstract data types \(ADT\)

We combine the data structures with their operations to simplify the process of solving problem which is called Abstract data types \(ADT\). Two parts of ADT: 1. Declaration of data 2. Declaration of operations
