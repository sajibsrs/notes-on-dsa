# Complexities table
Functions are arranged in ascending order according to their efficiency.

| Position |  Complexity   | Name               | Example                                          |
| :------: | :-----------: | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
|    1     |       1       | Constant           | Adding and element to the front of a linked list |
|    2     |     log N     | Logarithmic        | Finding and element in a sorted array            |
|    3     |       N       | Linear             | Finding an element in an unsorted array          |
|    4     |    N log N    | Linear Logarithmic | Sorting n items by divide-and-conquer Merge sort |
