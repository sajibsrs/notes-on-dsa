## Set

A set is very similar to array, except set doesn't allow _duplicate values_. There are different types of sets, but we'll discuss about _array-based_ set.

For this example we'll be using the same example from the array. This array is a set as all of it's items are unique.

```python
# python set
animals = {"dog", "cat", "cow", "goat", "sheep"}
```
> Python set elements are not changeable once created, but new elements can be added.

**or**
```go
// go example
var animals = [...]{"dog", "cat", "cow", "goat", "sheep"}
```

### Operational expenses

### Reading

> Required step = 1. Item in any position

It doesn't require much of explanation, as it's same as before.

### Searching

> Required steps best = 1, when it's the first item

> Required steps worst = $n$, when it's the last item

It doesn't require much of explanation as well.


### Insertion

However this requires some explanation:

> Required steps best = $n$ + 1, when it's the last item

That's because insertion at the end is 1 step, but we need comparison with $n$ items to determine its insertion position.

> Required steps worst = 2$n$ + 1, when it's the first item

Again, 1 step for insertion then moving $n$ items to right. But before insertion we have $n$ comparison to determine its insertion position. All together $n$ + $n$ + 1 = 2$n$ + 1.

### Deletion

Here, everything is same as before.

> Required steps best = 1, when it's the last item

> Required steps worst = $n$, when it's the first item
