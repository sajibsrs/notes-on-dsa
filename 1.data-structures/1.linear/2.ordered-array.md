## Ordered array

The `ordered array` is almost identical to the array. The only difference is ordered array has it's items sorted.

An `ordered array` might look like this:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```
**or**
```go
var numbers = [...]int{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
```

### Operational expenses

### Reading

> Required step = 1. Item in any position

Reding from any position inside an array is 1 step.

### Searching

> Required steps best = 1, when it's the first item

Searching for a specific item in side an array is 1 step if the item is the firt item of the array.

> Required steps worst = $n$, when it's the last item

Searching for an item inside an array is $n$ step in the array if the item is the last item of that array. Where $n$ is the number of total item count inside that array.

### Insertion

> Required steps best = 1, when it's the last item

This oprations has same effect as an array.

> Required steps worst = $n$ + 1, when it's the first item

Insertion 1 step and moving all elements to right is $n$ steps.

### Deletetion

> Required steps best = 1, when it's the last item

No additional steps needed. Just the insertion.

> Required steps worst = $n$, when it's the first item

1 step for the deletion and moving all remaining items to left $n$ - 1. It's $n$ - 1 + 1 = $n$ step.
