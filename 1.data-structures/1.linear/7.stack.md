## Stack
A stack is a collection of elements similar to array but with some key differences. The main key differences are:

* Data can be inserted only at the end of a stack.
* Data can be deleted only from the end of a stack.
* Only the last element can be read from a stack.

A stack can be imagined as a stack of plates. When a plate is placed at the top of the stack it is last to in and when a plate is taken from that stack that would be the first to out. That's why the stack is called mostly **LIFO** ( last in first out ) or **FILO** ( first in last out ).
