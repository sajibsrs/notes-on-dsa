# Data structures

## Data types

In the heart of computer there's only binary numbers, which is 1's and 0's. Solving real life problems in binary would have been extremely difficult if not impossible. To overcome this problem programming languages provides us data types. Integer, float, boolean, character etc are some of the most common data types.

### Primitive data types

Data types that are defined by system are called primitive data types. Int, float, double, char, string, bool etc are the common primitive or system defined data types.

### User-defined data types

For many situations only primitive data types are not enough. Most programming languages allow the users to define their own custom data types, which is called user-defined data types. Structures ( *struct* ) and classes are example of user-defined data types.

### Abstract data types (ADT)

Abstract data type is a data type which has structures with their operations to simplify the process of solving problem. Two parts of ADT: 

1. Declaration of data 
2. Declaration of operations

## Data structures

Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data, that can be used efficiently later on. Based on arrangement of the elements, data structures can be classified into two types:

### Linear data structures

Elements are accessed in a sequential order but sequentially storing them is not essential. Example:

* Array, Set, Hash map or Hash table, Linked list, Stack, Queue.

### Non-linear data structures

Elements are stored and accessed in a non-linear order. Example:

* Tree, Heap, Graph

### Node and node based data structures
Node is the building block for many data structures. Which is, the fundamental elements of node based structures. Some of the node based structures are:

* Linked lists
* Trees
* Graphs
